# Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.

Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such
as red or blue or disease and no disease.

ÂˆRegression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as
dollars or weight
