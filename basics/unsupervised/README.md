### Unsupervised learning
These are called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning above there is no
correct answers and there is no teacher. Algorithms are left to their own devises to discover and
present the interesting structure in the data. Unsupervised learning problems can be further
grouped into clustering and association problems.
 Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings
in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.
 Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules
that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy A also tend to buy B.
Some popular examples of unsupervised learning algorithms are:
 k-means for clustering problems.
 Apriori algorithm for association rule learning problems.
