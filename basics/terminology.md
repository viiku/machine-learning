A tabular data or spreadsheet data i.e Row, Columns and Cell often referred differently.

A row often describes an entity (like a person) or an observation about an entity. Another for a row of data or an observation as an instance. This is used because a row may be considered a single example or single instance of data observed or generated by the problem domain.

Columns for a row are often referred to as attributes of the observation. Another name for columns is features, used for the same reason as attribute, where a feature describes some property of the observation.

When modeling a problem it can reffered something like this.

    OutputAttribute = Program(InputAttributes)
